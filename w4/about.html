                <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
                <p>I decided to take this course because it was one of the classes that really interested me the most and I wanted to learn more about doing code and how it is to create your own web page. I took a class before that covered some of the basics of code, but it has been a long time since then and so I decided to take another to refresh my mind and even learn new things that I never knew about before.</p>

                <h2>What do you think of using chatGPT for researching your selected topic?</h2>
                <p>In my opinion, I actually found using chatGPT really helpful and a time saver in researching more about the topics I chose. Instead of searching through sites for the information I needed for my topic, chatGPT gathered what I needed for me and did so in a great and very informative way.</p>
