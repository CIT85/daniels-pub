                <h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
                <p>I decided to take this course because it was one of the classes that really interested me the most and I wanted to learn more about doing code and how it is to create your own web page. I took a class before that covered some of the basics of code, but it has been a long time since then and so I decided to take another to refresh my mind and even learn new things that I never knew about before.</p>

                <h2>What do you think of using chatGPT for researching your selected topic?</h2>
                <p>In my opinion, I actually found using chatGPT really helpful and a time saver in researching more about the topics I chose. Instead of searching through sites for the information I needed for my topic, chatGPT gathered what I needed for me and did so in a great and very informative way.</p>

            <h2>My Understanding of HTTPBin Output</h2>
            <p>HTTPBin is a useful tool for testing HTTP requests and response information.</p>
            <p>When submitting the form, HTTPBin will capture the form data and display it in a structured format which will show things such as the parameters, headers, and other relevant information.</p>
            <p>For example, if you're submitting a form with fields like name, email, and message, HTTPBin will show you exactly what data was sent in each of those fields. It will also show you details like the HTTP method used, any headers that were included in the request, and other metadata associated with the form submission.</p>
