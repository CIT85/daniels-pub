            <p>Begin your workout with a dynamic warm-up routine that targets the muscles and joints you'll be using during your weightlifting session. Include exercises such as bodyweight squats, lunges, arm circles, shoulder rotations, and light cardio to increase blood flow, elevate heart rate, and improve flexibility and mobility. Gradually increase the intensity of your warm-up to prepare your body for the heavier lifting to come.</p>
            <p>It is also a great Idea to <a href="subpage.html" style="text-decoration: underline; color: dodgerblue;">Stretch</a> properly before and after your workout to help warm-up your body further. </p>

            <hr>

            <p>Prioritize proper form and technique over lifting heavy weights. Focus on executing each exercise with control, precision, and full range of motion. Engage the appropriate muscles throughout each movement and avoid using momentum or compensatory movements to lift the weight. If you're unsure about proper form, seek guidance from a qualified fitness professional or coach, or consult reputable resources such as instructional videos or exercise tutorials.</p>

            <hr>

            <p>Avoid the temptation to lift weights that are too heavy for your current strength level, as this increases the risk of injury. Gradually increase the weight, sets, and repetitions over time as your strength and technique improve. Listen to your body and pay attention to signs of fatigue, discomfort, or pain. If something doesn't feel right, don't push through itâ€”modify the exercise, reduce the weight, or take a break as needed.</p>

            <p>Allow adequate time for recovery between weightlifting sessions to give your muscles, joints, and nervous system time to repair and adapt to the stress of exercise.Include rest days in your workout schedule to prevent overtraining and reduce the risk of overuse injuries. Prioritize quality sleep, hydration, nutrition, and stress management to support your body's recovery processes and optimize performance.</p>
