# My Project Topic
The topic that I selected for this project is going to do with exercising, but primarily focusing on weight lifting. I decided on this topic because working out is one of my favorite hobbies and its something I really like to do. I know a pretty good amount about it and so I feel like I can create a page dedicated to some weight lifting workouts that are useful and what parts of the body they are good for. I also have ideas for what I will include in the other pages about the benefits and the dangers of some workouts, maybe even discussing the benefits of using certain supplements too. For the headings on my page, it would be the type of lifting exercise that I am going to discuss. I would also include pictures that show how the certain exercise is performed and have text to explain how to do it and the benefits of it. For the menu, I would have a list that has the name of all the workouts that I will be discussing so that you can click on one of them to take you to that part of my page.

What I used in this part of my project is flexbox. I used flexbox for two main parts of my page such as for the navigation and for the footer. Both of these I styled in my css so that they stood out and were visually more appealing to look at. The styling I did was make both the nav and footer to display in flex view or flexbox. I then made adjustments to the padding and border of the flexboxs while also aligning the text in the center. I moved onto adjusting these further in both classes like "nav a" and "footer a" with making the flex auto and further adjusting the padding and margins. I had no text decoration for either and I made the font weight bold. I also continued to make adjustments to when you hover over the tabs such as making the text a very light blue color to match my page while also having a white outline around it and the text having an underline below it. Making these adjustments and adding the use of flexbox to my page made it stand out more in these two main parts and I really like how it turned out. 
To create the subpage, I used the "<a>" anchor tag that is used to create hyperlinks with "href" to specify the URL of the linked source which was my "subpage.html" page. I used the word "stretch" to be the link to it while also adding a text decoration within it being underlined and putting a blue color on it so it stands out. Once you click the word, it takes you to another page that I made called "The Importance of Stretching". I also used the "<strong>" element in it for certain parts in my ordered list list items so the text stands out more. I even used this element in my main page the "index.html" or "Strong Foundations: Building Strength Through Weightlifting" for the ordered list list items there too. I feel like this element helps in adding more to my page and feel more completed.

one of the three common break points standards that I chose from the list was the one called "Bootstrap breakpoints". 

For the small media query, I went with different shades of blue for the whole page and even changed the font family that was used. Everything from the header, nav, table, and footer have been adjusted to the way I wanted it to be.

For the medium media query, I went with different shades of red and made many adjustments to the same areas that I did for the small media query so that it fit with the color that I chose for the page. The font family is also different too.

For the large media query, I went with different shades of green for it. In this one, I did the same with changing the whole page and the way it looked, but I also made the font size for all pages bigger since the page is viewed much bigger than the others. 

For the XL media query, I chose different shades of brown for it and I believe that it came out exactly how I wanted it to with the colors and the layout of it. I also continued with making the font size bigger just like I did for the large media query. 

For the Media device landscape, I decided to keep it the same way it was originally in the small medium query since I liked what I did there and felt like it would be better than adding another different variation to my pages. 

Overall, I like the way every page turned out and even though I didn't make too many adjustments to certain ares in my page layout, especially with the images, I believe that the way it already is, is perfect for my page and doesn't need to be changed.
