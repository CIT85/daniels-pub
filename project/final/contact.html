        <p>I started my workout journey back in 2020 during the covid pandemic. Due to lockdown, I didn't have many things that I could do. So, I decided that maybe it was time for me to try and get my body in the best shape that I could. Fast forward to now in 2024, I am in the best shape that I have ever been in, but I still am a ways from where I want to be at which is why I still am working out in any free time that I have today. It is truly one of the things that I love to do and really enjoy!</p>

        <h2>Why I chose this topic for my project</h2>
        <p>I actually chose this topic for this project because I really enjoy and have a strong passion for working out, especially when it comes to weightlifting. I am in no way a professional at this, but I do think that I have a good amount of knowledge and experience in this field, which is why I decided to go with this topic and talk about some of the best workouts for different parts of the body to build strength and feel great.</p>
    <!-- </li>

        <h2>Why should you start</h2>
        <p>I believe that if you are wanting to start your workout journey, then you should for many reasons. Working out will be the best thing for your health in the long run and it doesn't only change you physically, but also mentally in a great way. You learn many things about yourself and pick up on traits that are important even outside of working out, such as discipline. discipline is one of the most important things that I have picked up on in my journey, and it has changed me for the better. The start of the journey may not be the greatest feeling, but after some time and dedication to it, you start to feel great in so many ways that you may have not before.</p>
