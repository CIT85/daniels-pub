      <h2>Why stretching is crucial</h2>
      <p>
        Stretching before and after weightlifting is crucial for several reasons:</p>
        <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Injury Prevention:</strong> Dynamic stretching before lifting helps increase blood flow to the muscles, making them more pliable and less prone to injury during the workout. Static stretching after lifting helps relax the muscles and prevent them from becoming overly tight, reducing the risk of injury later on.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Improved Range of Motion:</strong> Stretching before lifting can improve your range of motion, allowing you to perform exercises with proper form and a full range of motion. This can lead to better muscle activation and more effective workouts.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Enhanced Performance:</strong> Proper stretching can improve your performance during weightlifting by preparing your muscles and joints for the movements you'll be performing. This can help you lift more weight, perform more repetitions, and achieve better results.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Reduced Muscle Soreness:</strong> Stretching after weightlifting can help reduce muscle soreness and stiffness by promoting blood flow to the muscles and aiding in the removal of waste products like lactic acid. This can help you recover faster and feel less sore after your workouts.
        </li>
    </ol>
           <p>Overall, incorporating stretching into your weightlifting routine can help you stay injury-free, improve your performance, and enhance your recovery, allowing you to get the most out of your workouts.</p>
