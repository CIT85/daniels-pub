            <h2>Why I want to travel</h2>
            <p>There are a many reasons why I would want to travel to different places around the United States or even outside of it. One of the main reasons is because I want to see and experience new things that I haven't before. It's always been an interest of mine to visit different places and maybe even consider living there in the future to experience the culture and try out new things that I am not used to especially since I have only ever lived here in Fresno, California my whole life and have yet to travel.</p>

Here are some facts about Phoenix, Arizona that I learned. Phoenix is the capital and largest city in Arizona. It is one of the largest cities in the United States too. Phoenix is partly known for the weather and most of the time always being warm. The sunny weather over there is part of many reasons why people love to live in Arizona. They don't really have that many cold weather days like other places around the world. I also learned that Arizona is one of the states that doesn't have daylight savings time. They have the Grand Canyon National Park located here too and people could go and visit. It also has many Deserts here and that's also including food Deserts. They have one of the most known deserts here which is called the Sonoran Desert. I seen and read how there's many things you can do in Arizona. They have things like tours where you can go to places like the Canyon tours, Jeep and Off road tours, Sedona tours, Hot air balloon flights, Helicopter rides and many other things that Have to do with touring and exploring.

            <h2>Miami, Florida</h2>
            <p>The second place that I researched about and would want to visit and maybe even live at in the future would be Miami, Florida. Miami, Florida is another place that I would want to visit someday and may even consider living at. Some things that I learned and seen about Miami is the beaches there. They have 16 beaches in Miami that you could visit and chill at. Most people go on vacation to Miami for this reason. The city is also known for it's center of trade, arts, finance, commerce, culture, and having the largest urban economy. They have a place called the Bayside Marketplace which is an outdoor mall and it's popular to most tourists and locals. People come here to mostly shop but there's also other things like several restaurants, cafes, and live entertainment for people to see with the views of the waterfront because of how close it is. Another famous place in Miami, Florida is Little Havana. Little Havana is a cuban district that people go to because it's full of unique restaurants and local shops that can't be found anywhere else in the city. So it becomes a very popular place for people to go to and explore. The zoo in Miami is another place that people go to. They have all the animals in an enclosure that looks similar to their own natural habitat instead of putting them in cages where they could be stuck. They allow them to have the chance to interact with other animals too and even have over 3,000 animals with 30 endangered species at the Miami Zoo. Miami has museums for people to visit and even has a place called Deering Estate that's on the National Register of Historic Places. From the Miami Cuisines, Cuban Coffee, The nightlife, the Ultra Music Festival, and it's iconic buildings, it's clear why many people would want to visit Miami, Florida.</p>

They have one of the most visited beaches which is the Santa Monica Beach. Not only do they have the beach there but they have many great restaurants to go to and the nightlife spots there are places you wouldn't want to miss. The soft sand and perfect weather with many things you can do gives people reasons to go there and tourists to visit too.

Studio tour in hollywood that you can take and you can take a tour through Hollywood and Beverly Hills and see some of the area's landmarks and celebrity homes if you wanted to. Most of all for people who like sightseeing, they have many places you can go to see all of the cities top attractions from Venice Beach to the Sunset Strip to Griffith Park, and many more.
