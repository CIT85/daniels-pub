            Hello, my name is Daniel Sorondo and the image above is actually an AI generated image of a Native American sitting next to a wolf by a fire in the woods at night.

        <ul>
            <li>Why are you taking this course?
                <p>I decided to take this course because it was one of the classes that really interested me the most and I wanted to learn more about doing code and how it is to create your own web page. I took a class before that covered some of the basics of code, but it has been a long time since then and so I decided to take another to refresh my mind and even learn new things that I never knew about before.</p>
            </li>
            <li>What do you think of using chatGPT for researching your selected topic?
                <p>In my opinion, I actually found using chatGPT really helpful and a time saver in researching more about the topics I chose. </p>
            </li>
        </ul>
